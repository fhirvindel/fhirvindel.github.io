# Flipbook Site

A simple responsive website that looks and feels like a book. It features:

- 3D page flip animation (front/back covers included)
- Click corners, Prev/Next buttons, and keyboard arrows
- Drag/swipe to flip (basic threshold)
- Bookmarks menu to jump to specific pages
- Responsive design for small screens (notepad-style)

## Run Locally

Simply open `all/index.html` in your browser.

Optionally, start a local server (if you have Python installed):

```powershell
python -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080/all/index.html
```

## Customize

- Edit `all/script.js` to change page titles and contents.
- Adjust styles in `all/styles.css` for colors and layout.
- Add images to `all/képek/` and reference them inside pages.
